Hyper-OPs
=========
My DevOps toolkit for dealing with Hyper-V.

Install Options
---------------
**Remote PowerShell Option A** Install-CorePackages.ps1

Installs the following package managers
* [scoop](http://scoop.sh/) - Seems to have most current stable more
often than chocolatey. Also install under user scope so no admin needed.
Trying it out.
* [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) - Better install parameter
support, wider selection, popping up in more and more places.
